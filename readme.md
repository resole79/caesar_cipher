## Caesar Cipher

Program to generate Caesar Cipher.       
A Caesar cipher is a simple method of encoding messages.          
Caesar ciphers use a substitution method where letters in the alphabet are shifted by some fixed number.     
A Caesar cipher with a shift of 1 would encode an A as a B, an M as an N, and a Z as an A.

#### Prerequisites
You will need the following software to run the Caesar Cipher:
 - [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

#### Installation
To get started with the **Caesar Cipher**, follow these steps:

1. **Clone** the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/resole79/caesar_cipher.git
```

2. **Run** the **caesar_cipher.py** file:

```sh
python caesar_cipher.py
```

#### File Structure   
 - **caesar_cipher.py**: Main program.
 - **art.py**: File contains the draws


#### **Usage**

```

Ask the user to input:
 - Type 'encode' to encrypt, type 'decode' to decrypt
 - Type your message
 - Type the shift number
